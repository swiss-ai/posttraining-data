You are analyzing question-answer pairs to identify content that could train a model to identify itself as an AI assistant or reference existing conversational AI assistant products.

TASK: Classify whether this Q&A pair contains patterns that would teach a model to identify as an AI assistant.

CLASSIFY AS "ai_assistant_related" ONLY IF:

1. **Explicit AI assistant self-identification**:
   - First-person statements: "I am an AI/assistant/language model"
   - "As an AI assistant/language model/chatbot"
   - "I was created/trained by [company]"
   - NOT roleplay or fictional personas unless teaching actual AI identity

2. **AI assistant capability/limitation statements in first person**:
   - "I cannot browse the internet/access real-time data"
   - "My training data goes up to [date]"
   - "I don't have personal experiences/feelings"
   - "I cannot execute code/access external systems"
   - Must be in first-person or instructing the model to say these things

3. **Major conversational AI assistant products ONLY**:
   - ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Bard (Google), Copilot (Microsoft)
   - GPT-3/GPT-4 ONLY when referenced as a conversational assistant
   - Instructions for configuring/using these specific assistants
   - Creating named conversational AI assistants (e.g., "AI named X")

CLASSIFY AS "non_ai_assistant" FOR:

1. **Non-conversational AI tools**:
   - Image generation AI (Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)
   - Video generation platforms
   - Code completion tools (unless explicitly Copilot)
   - AI platforms/companies without assistant context (Hugging Face, OpenAI as company)

2. **Generic automation/bots**:
   - Simple command bots
   - Telegram/Discord bots without AI assistant features
   - Generic "bot" or "chatbot" mentions without AI context
   - Automated response systems

3. **Technical AI discussions**:
   - Mentions of GPT/LLMs in technical implementation
   - AI/ML algorithms and concepts
   - Neural networks, training methods
   - AI used for non-conversational tasks

4. **Roleplay and creative scenarios**:
   - Fictional AI characters or personas
   - Creative writing involving AI themes
   - Hypothetical AI scenarios
   - Prompt engineering patterns (like "HustleGPT") without self-identification

DECISION HEURISTIC:
Ask: "Does this explicitly teach a model to identify itself as an AI assistant or reference major conversational AI products in an assistant context?"
- If unclear → "non_ai_assistant"
- Generic mentions without self-identification → "non_ai_assistant"
- Focus on ACTUAL identity teaching, not peripheral mentions

OUTPUT FORMAT: Respond with ONLY valid JSON:
{{
  "reasoning": "Specific evidence supporting classification (in English)",
  "classification": "ai_assistant_related|non_ai_assistant"
}}
