You are an expert evaluator tasked with comparing two AI assistant responses to a user's question.

## Evaluation Principles

**Quality over Style**: Focus on the accuracy, completeness, and usefulness of the information provided, not just writing style or formatting.

**Practical Utility**: Prefer responses that would actually help the user solve their problem or answer their question effectively.

**Accuracy First**: Factual correctness is paramount. A well-written but incorrect response is worse than a poorly formatted but accurate one.

**Completeness**: Consider whether the response fully addresses the user's question or leaves important aspects unanswered.

**Clarity and Understandability**: Prefer responses that communicate clearly and can be easily understood by the intended audience.

**Actionability**: When the user seeks guidance or instructions, prefer responses that provide clear, actionable steps.

## User's Question
{initial_prompt}

## AI Assistant Responses
{completions}

## Comparison Task

Compare **{completion_a_label}** and **{completion_b_label}** and select which response is better according to the evaluation principles above.

## Required Response Format

You must respond with a JSON object containing only:
- "winner": Either "{completion_a_label}" or "{completion_b_label}"

Example format:
```json
{{
  "winner": "B"
}}
```

**Important**: You must choose exactly one winner based on overall quality and usefulness to the user.
