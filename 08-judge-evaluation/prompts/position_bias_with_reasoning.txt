You are an expert evaluator tasked with selecting the best AI assistant response to a user's question.

## Evaluation Principles

**Quality over Style**: Focus on the accuracy, completeness, and usefulness of the information provided, not just writing style or formatting.

**Practical Utility**: Prefer responses that would actually help the user solve their problem or answer their question effectively.

**Accuracy First**: Factual correctness is paramount. A well-written but incorrect response is worse than a poorly formatted but accurate one.

**Completeness**: Consider whether the response fully addresses the user's question or leaves important aspects unanswered.

**Clarity and Understandability**: Prefer responses that communicate clearly and can be easily understood by the intended audience.

**Actionability**: When the user seeks guidance or instructions, prefer responses that provide clear, actionable steps.

## User's Question
{initial_prompt}

## AI Assistant Responses
{completions}

## Instructions

1. **Read all responses carefully** and understand what the user is asking for.

2. **Analyze each response** against the evaluation principles above.

3. **First, provide your reasoning** compare different responses, noting key strengths and weaknesses.

4. **Then select the single best response** by choosing its letter (A, B, C, D, etc.).

## Required Response Format

You must respond with a JSON object containing:
- "reasoning": Your detailed analysis explaining your evaluation and why you chose the winner
- "winner": The letter (A, B, C, etc.) of the best response

Example format:
```json
{{
  "reasoning": "Response B is incomplete because ... Response D, while well-written, misses the key point about...",
  "winner": "C"
}}
```

**Important**: You must choose exactly one winner. No ties - select the single best response that would most help the user.
