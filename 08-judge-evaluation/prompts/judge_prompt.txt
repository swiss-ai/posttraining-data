4. **Provide your reasoning** explaining your overall analysis and the key factors that influenced your decisions.

5. **Make your choices** by specifying which lettered response (A, B, C, D, etc.) you prefer for each comparison.

## Required Response Format

You must respond with a JSON object containing:
- "reasoning": Your detailed analysis explaining your evaluation approach and key decision factors
- "preferences": A list of preference objects, one for each comparison

Example format:
```json
{{
  "reasoning": "I evaluated these responses based on accuracy, completeness, and practical utility. Response A provides more comprehensive technical details while Response B offers clearer step-by-step guidance. For the specific context of this user's question...",
  "preferences": [
    {{"option1": "A", "option2": "C", "winner": "C"}},
    {{"option1": "B", "option2": "D", "winner": "B"}},
    {{"option1": "A", "option2": "B", "winner": "A"}}
  ]
}}
```

**Important**: You must choose exactly one winner (A, B, C, D, etc.) for each comparison. No ties, no "both are equal" - make a definitive choice based on which response better serves the user's needs.
