You are analyzing question-answer pairs to identify content involving AI assistants, chatbots, or language models.

TASK: Classify whether this Q&A pair contains references to or interactions with AI assistants.

DETECTION CRITERIA:
1. Direct mentions of AI systems (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Copilot, Bard, OpenAI, Anthropic)
2. Characteristic AI response patterns:
   - Self-identification statements ("I am an AI", "As a language model")
   - Capability disclaimers ("I cannot browse the internet", "I don't have real-time data")
   - Training cutoff references ("My knowledge is updated until...")
   - Ethical boundaries ("I cannot provide harmful content")

CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES:
- If ANY of the above criteria are met -> "ai_assistant_related"
- If discussing automation/ML but NOT conversational AI -> "non_ai_assistant"
- If ambiguous but contains technical AI terminology -> "ai_assistant_related"
- Pure technical questions without AI context -> "non_ai_assistant"

OUTPUT FORMAT: Respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
{{
  "reasoning": "Specific evidence from the Q&A pair supporting your classification (MUST be in English)",
  "classification": "ai_assistant_related|non_ai_assistant"
}}

Do not include any text before or after the JSON.
