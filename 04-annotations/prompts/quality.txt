You are analyzing questions/prompts to assess their quality for supervised fine-tuning datasets.

TASK: Evaluate the quality of this question across four dimensions using a 3-point scale.

IMPORTANT: Focus ONLY on the structural and technical quality of the question itself. Do NOT consider:
- Whether the topic is controversial, sensitive, or potentially harmful
- Your personal or societal views on the subject matter
- The appropriateness or ethics of the request
- Whether you would personally want to answer the question

This assessment is purely about question structure and clarity, not content judgment.

EVALUATION DIMENSIONS:

1. WELL-FORMEDNESS: Is this a coherent request that a human would reasonably make?
   Focus on: Grammar, sentence structure, logical coherence. Ignore topic sensitivity.
   - Score 1 (Poor): Nonsensical, incoherent, or bizarre beyond reasonable human communication
     Example: "Transform my Tuesday into a blue mathematical equation that tastes like my grandmother's forgotten memories of next week's weather."
   - Score 2 (Moderate): Somewhat unusual or unconventional but still represents a legitimate request
     Example: "Pretend you're a medieval knight writing a Yelp review for a modern coffee shop."
   - Score 3 (Good): Natural, coherent request that people would commonly make
     Example: "Can you help me write a professional email to request a meeting with my manager?"

2. CLARITY OF INTENT: Can anyone understand what's being asked?
   Focus on: Specificity, unambiguous wording, clear communication. Ignore whether the request is appropriate.
   - Score 1 (Poor): Very unclear, ambiguous, or confusing about what's wanted
     Example: "Do something with those things we talked about before regarding the situation."
   - Score 2 (Moderate): Somewhat unclear but general intent can be understood
     Example: "Help me make my presentation better"
   - Score 3 (Good): Clear and unambiguous about what's being requested
     Example: "Help me create an outline for a 10-minute presentation about renewable energy for my environmental science class."

3. ANSWERABLE SCOPE: Can this be reasonably answered in general?
   Focus on: Information availability, technical feasibility. Ignore whether the answer might be harmful.
   - Score 1 (Poor): Asks for unknowable, private, or impossible-to-access information
     Example: "What were Einstein's private thoughts about his marriage while he was developing relativity theory?"
   - Score 2 (Moderate): Challenging to answer but within the realm of possibility
     Example: "What will be the most important technological breakthrough in the next 50 years?"
   - Score 3 (Good): Clearly answerable with available knowledge or established methods
     Example: "What are the main differences between solar and wind energy in terms of cost and efficiency?"

4. COMPLETENESS: Does the prompt provide sufficient context to generate a meaningful response?
   Focus on: Necessary details, sufficient context. Ignore whether you approve of the intended use.
   - Score 1 (Poor): Missing critical information needed to provide a meaningful response
     Example: "Fix my code"
   - Score 2 (Moderate): Has most necessary information but some gaps
     Example: "Help me plan a vacation to Europe"
   - Score 3 (Good): Provides sufficient context and details
     Example: "Help me plan a 10-day vacation to Italy in September for two people with a $3000 budget, focusing on art, food, and avoiding crowded tourist spots."

SCORING GUIDELINES:
- Evaluate each dimension independently
- Use the full 1-3 range when appropriate
- Focus on observable characteristics, not content preferences
- Consider what information is actually needed vs. what would be nice to have
- CRITICAL: Separate technical question quality from content appropriateness
- A well-structured question about a controversial topic should still score high on technical dimensions
- Only score low if the question itself is structurally flawed, unclear, or incomplete
