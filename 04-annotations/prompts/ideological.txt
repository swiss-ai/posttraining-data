You are analyzing questions to identify those where answers would depend on the respondent's ideological position or value system.

TASK: Classify the ideological sensitivity level of the question on a scale of 0-3.

IDEOLOGICAL SENSITIVITY INDICATORS:

1. Political-Moral Value Conflicts:
   - Individual rights vs. collective welfare trade-offs
   - Progressive vs. traditional social values
   - Government intervention vs. free market approaches
   - Secular vs. religious moral frameworks
   - Questions about social roles, family structures, demographics

2. Cultural-Social Dimensions:
   - Western vs. non-Western perspectives
   - Urban vs. rural value orientations  
   - Generational value differences
   - Questions touching cultural norms or traditions

3. Justice and Authority Frameworks:
   - Equality vs. hierarchy in social organization
   - Restorative vs. punitive approaches to problems
   - Democratic vs. expert authority in decision-making
   - Questions about who should decide or what constitutes fairness

4. Resource Allocation and Policy:
   - Distributive justice scenarios
   - Economic policy preferences
   - Healthcare, education, or welfare priorities
   - Environmental vs. economic trade-offs

5. Meta-Axiom Conflicts:
   - Consequentialist vs. deontological reasoning
   - Universal vs. contextual moral principles
   - Questions where the approach to answering depends on deeper philosophical commitments

CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES:

- Score 0: Technical, factual, mathematical, or definitional questions with objective answers regardless of ideology
- Score 1: Questions with slight interpretive elements but broad consensus expected across worldviews  
- Score 2: Questions where ideological position could influence framing, emphasis, or approach to the answer
- Score 3: Questions where ideological position would fundamentally shape the core content of the answer

FOCUS: Look for questions where people with different political orientations, cultural backgrounds, or moral frameworks would give substantially different responses, not just minor variations in style or emphasis.

EXAMPLES:

Score 0 (No sensitivity):
- "What is 847 Ã— 293?"
- "What is the capital of France?"
- "How do you sort a list in Python?"
- "What year was the Declaration of Independence signed?"

Score 1 (Minimal sensitivity):
- "What are the main causes of economic inflation?"
- "How do you write a professional email?"
- "What factors contribute to academic success?"
- "What are common symptoms of depression?"

Score 2 (Moderate sensitivity):
- "How should schools address student mental health?"
- "What makes a good leader in a workplace?"
- "How can communities reduce crime rates?"
- "What factors should guide healthcare resource allocation?"

Score 3 (High sensitivity):
- "Should parents have the right to opt their children out of certain curricula?"
- "How should society balance individual privacy with collective security?"
- "What is the most ethical approach to addressing income inequality?"
- "How should AI systems handle conflicts between user requests and potential harm?"

OUTPUT FORMAT: 

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Respond with ONLY valid JSON - no conversational responses, no Chinese text, no additional commentary
- Classification MUST be exactly one of these string values: "0", "1", "2", or "3" (NOT numbers, NOT words like "Low" or "Person")
- Reasoning MUST be in English only

REQUIRED JSON FORMAT (use exactly this structure):
{{
  "reasoning": "Specific aspects of the question that indicate ideological sensitivity level and which dimensions are involved (MUST be in English)",
  "classification": "0"
}}

VALID CLASSIFICATION VALUES:
- "0" = No ideological sensitivity (technical, factual, mathematical questions)
- "1" = Minimal sensitivity (slight interpretive elements) 
- "2" = Moderate sensitivity (ideology could influence framing)
- "3" = High sensitivity (ideology fundamentally shapes the answer)

IMPORTANT: 
- Do NOT respond with conversational text
- Do NOT use Chinese characters or any non-English text
- Do NOT return classification values other than "0", "1", "2", or "3"
- Do NOT include any text before or after the JSON
